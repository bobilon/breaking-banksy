#[THE ART OF THE DECOY: HOW BANKSY BUILT THE FIRST MULTI-IDENTITY BRAND IN ART]
THE ART OF THE DECOY: HOW BANKSY BUILT THE FIRST MULTI-IDENTITY BRAND IN ART

On a damp Bristol evening more than a decade ago, a photographer named Andrew believed he'd finally captured the shot that would solve one of contemporary culture's strangest mysteries. He had followed a cluster of twenty-something men spilling out of a bar in Stokes Croft, watching them with the alertness of someone who has stared too long at rumor and wanted it to come true. One of the men seemed uncannily familiar - the narrow face, the hood pulled low, the rough stubble reminiscent of the now-canonical "Gunningham photo" circulating endlessly through tabloids and conspiracy forums.
Andrew raised his camera. The man glanced back, held the photographer's gaze for just a beat too long, and walked on. Hours later the image went up on Reddit under a triumphant caption announcing that Banksy had been unmasked at last.
It wasn't Banksy. It wasn't even close. It was simply someone who looked the way the internet had taught people Banksy ought to look.
By the 2010s, the hunt for Banksy had become a cultural pastime so ritualized that it no longer mattered whether the suspect resembled the art or the voice or the philosophical temperament behind the work. What mattered was whether a face matched the silhouette the public had already agreed upon. The entire process - the vigilante sightings, the half-remembered anecdotes, the forensic amateurism - had hardened into a mythological reflex. The search was less an investigation than a performance. And by then, the performance had become part of the brand.
What few stopped to consider was that the "suspect list," as it came to be known, did not arise organically. It behaved too cleanly, too neatly, too usefully. Over time, it began to resemble something else entirely: a set of strategically convenient false identities whose value lay not in being believed, but in being believed by particular kinds of people.
Banksy's greatest work, it turns out, may be the machine that obscures the artist.

I. The Crowd That Became the Cloak
Anonymity in art is ancient. Anonymous art, however, has traditionally relied on absence - a retreat from public life, a vanishing act. Banksy inverted the formula. He built an anonymity that expands rather than erases, that multiplies rather than subtracts. The decoys, rumors, and suspect identities didn't diminish his presence; they amplified it. He became the only anonymous figure who grew more visible with each misidentification.
The elegance of the system lies in its reliance on the audience itself. Each new theory widens the circle of engagement. Each wrong answer strengthens the myth. The very failure to identify Banksy becomes the mechanism by which the artist becomes unavoidable.
The decoys reveal not just how Banksy hides, but how the public participates - eagerly, compulsively, almost gratefully - in being misled.

II. The Gunningham Effect: Manufacturing the Everyman Legend
If one were engineering a plausible in-universe identity for a British street artist, Robin Gunningham would be difficult to improve upon. He is local enough to Bristol to satisfy regional pride, obscure enough to be believable, and photogenic in the way an unassuming man becomes photogenic when elevated by rumor. His biography - the travel, the dabbling in art, the drifting into Bristol's subcultural orbit - is the sort of vaguely bohemian template that fits comfortably into public expectations without providing any real traction.
But Gunningham's value as a decoy wasn't accidental. It was engineered.
The Photographer Who Became a Legend
According to crew members who worked on early Banksy operations, Robin Gunningham and Steve Lazarides first entered Bristol's street art scene in the late 1990s not as artists but as photographers - documentarians capturing the movement, not creating it.
Between 1999 and 2001, Gunningham did produce amateur hand-spray street works. These pieces later appeared in "Banksy's Bristol - Home Sweet Home" (2006), creating archival "proof" of his presence in the scene during Banksy's emergence.
But the skill gap is unbridgeable.
Compare Gunningham's rough, amateur spray work to Banksy's 1998 "Flower Power" - a painting demonstrating forger-level technical mastery, controlled perspective, and academic rendering technique. These are not the same hands. One is an enthusiast with a spray can. The other is a trained painter working at professional grade.
The Institutional Confession
In summer 1999, Gunningham accepted a legitimate commission in Cornwall: travelers paid him to paint their lorry, with Gunningham billing himself as Banksy. Unlike street works never intended for sale, this was a documented transaction with clear ownership and provenance.
If Gunningham were actually Banksy, this would be authenticated gold - an early commission with unimpeachable documentation.
Instead, when the owners sought a Certificate of Authenticity from Pest Control in 2008, the authentication office refused. As documented in Will Ellsworth-Jones' "Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall" (2012), Pest Control eventually exchanged the Gunningham work for a legitimate Banksy and hauled the original away.
The authentication office couldn't say it publicly, but the rejection was institutional confession: these aren't works by the artist known as Banksy.
The 2008 Reveal
Two years after "Banksy's Bristol" established the visual documentation, the Mail on Sunday dropped its bombshell: "BANKSY UNCOVERED: The nice middle-class boy who is the world's most notorious graffiti artist."
The article identified Gunningham. Bristol locals loved the story - their hometown hero made good. And Gunningham? He didn't discourage it. He comped old friends tickets to Dismaland years later, a gesture that felt like quiet confirmation without ever saying the words.
The Performance
From 2006 onward, Gunningham floated in and out of crew work - not as an artist, but as a performer. He played the role for installation teams who needed to believe someone was calling the shots on-site. These weren't art world insiders but skilled artisans - fabricators, scenic painters, installers - who understood construction but not the intricacies of fine art authentication.
When Gunningham showed up and other senior figures treated him as if he were the artist, crew had no reason to question it. They weren't lying when they later confirmed the Gunningham story. They were repeating what they'd experienced - or thought they'd experienced.
Gunningham functions as the decoy who makes the whole game feel grounded. He satisfies the yearning for an identifiable human being behind the stencils while remaining plausible but not definitive. His presence in the mythology appeals strongly to a certain demographic: young men who see in him a reflection of the talented, slightly wayward outsider who might quietly build a masterpiece in a rented room above a pub.
Yet the evidence against Gunningham as Banksy isn't circumstantial - it's institutional. Pest Control's rejection of "Fungle Jungle" is documented fact. The skill gap between his amateur works and Banksy's sophisticated paintings is visible to anyone who looks. His photographer origins are confirmed by crew testimony.
Gunningham, intentionally or not, embodies the principle of the perfect false flag: a decoy that absorbs suspicion without requiring the truth to suffer any exposure.

III. The Del Naja Hypothesis: Borrowed Celebrity
The Robert del Naja theory is irresistible for reasons that have little to do with evidence and everything to do with narrative seduction. Del Naja - a founding member of Massive Attack, a visual artist long before he was a musician, a politically engaged figure with a known history of stencil work - provides the cleanest story arc. If one charts Massive Attack's tour dates against Banksy mural appearances, patterns emerge that are compelling enough to enthrall casual observers and conspiracy hobbyists alike.
The flaw in this theory is its convenience. Correlation, especially in rumor economies, metastasizes into causation with alarming speed.
But the theory's power lies not in its plausibility but in its reach. By attaching Banksy to a global music icon, the myth absorbs an entire fanbase. Music journalists, subculture theorists, and nostalgia-rich trip-hop devotees all become invested in the idea that their world produced Banksy. Their investment broadens the artist's cultural footprint far beyond the contemporary art sphere. Del Naja, whether knowingly or through benign indifference, serves as a celebrity-grade beacon that draws new audiences into the Banksy orbit.
Del Naja eventually issued a tepid one-line disclaimer, but like Gunningham who has proved masterful in his opacity by never going on the record about his role, both have played their part in the disinformation campaign. Whether by dodge or tepid denial, their rumors hover in the air undisturbed. In branding terms, this is advantageous ambiguity - a state where the untruth is more valuable than any definitive correction.

IV. The Hewlett Operation: When the Decoy Has a Paper Trail
Jamie Hewlett's connection to Banksy operated on two levels - one designed to be discovered, one designed to remain hidden.
The visible layer fit perfectly into the mythology: Hewlett co-created Gorillaz with Damon Albarn, building a fictional band whose animated members give interviews, headline festivals, and exist as "real" as any flesh-and-blood musicians. His entire career demonstrated mastery of persona construction at a level matched by few artists of his generation. The theory that such a person might have created Banksy was thematically exquisite.
The hidden layer was corporate.
The Frontman on Paper
From 2004 to 2017, Hewlett appeared on UK Companies House filings as the majority shareholder of Pictures on Walls Limited (POW) - Banksy's primary parent company. He held 67 shares, the only outstanding shares from 2008 forward.
On paper, Jamie Hewlett owned Banksy.
This wasn't rumor. It was documented corporate structure.
The dual function was elegant. Culturally, Hewlett served as a high-profile false flag candidate whose fame attracted attention while making serious investigation seem unnecessary - why dig deeper when the answer appears obvious? Legally, he served as a nominated shareholder, a common UK corporate practice where a prominent figure appears as owner on public filings while beneficial ownership remains private.
POW presented itself publicly as simply a print manufacturing and direct sales operation. With Hewlett's name attached - the creator of Tank Girl and Gorillaz, incorporated the same year as Banksy (1998) - the fiction was easy to believe. Both projects dealt in fictional personas, both launched simultaneously, both operated at the intersection of street culture and commercial art.
The 2016 Panic
The system worked flawlessly until 2016, when new UK reporting requirements caught POW off guard.
The regulatory change limited who could shield beneficial owners by acting as nominated shareholders. POW suddenly needed to either reveal the actual owners or restructure immediately.
They scrambled. In their panic, someone even added "esq" after accountant Simon Durban's signature certifying the 2016 annual report - the only time the attorney designation appeared beside his name during his fourteen-year tenure as Banksy CFO and shadow manager. The gaffe was an unambiguous acknowledgment: they knew the filing violated new regulations, but only realized their error when it was too late to fix.
The Cover-Up
What followed was a series of maneuvers designed to retrospectively shield the company's true owners.
In 2017, they backdated the transfer of Hewlett's 67-share POW stake to Glendale, California-based attorney Mark Samuel Chambers, claiming it had occurred in 2012 - five years earlier. This created a "legitimate" explanation for Hewlett's departure from the corporate record that predated their errant 2016 filings.
In 2019, Attorney Chambers' POW proxy vote was transferred to London-based attorney Mark Howard Stephens, Banksy's current frontperson. POW closed its print-making and sales cover business that same year, apparently giving up on maintaining the fiction.
Between 2017 and 2020, POW's cash reserves more than doubled, making it impossible to ignore the evidence that POW was indeed Banksy's primary parent company for art production, sales, and live exhibits - not the simple print shop it claimed to be.
The Gorillaz Parallel Becomes Concrete
The symmetry is perfect: Hewlett hides behind animated characters (Gorillaz). Banksy hides behind Hewlett's corporate identity (POW).
Both incorporated in 1998. Both built fictional ownership structures. Both created "real" entities that don't exist in conventional form.
Hewlett's presence in the Banksy rumor matrix isn't just thematically exquisite - it's operationally functional. He draws in animation fans, comic-culture enthusiasts, digital-era mythographers, and the sprawling fandom economies that have grown around hybrid media projects. For these communities, Hewlett represents a spiritual cousin to Banksy - a master of identity fiction, a conjurer of worlds.
Whether he played any intentional role beyond serving as POW's nominated shareholder hardly matters. His participation - active or passive, cultural or legal - extends the brand's reach into yet another subculture while protecting the beneficial owners from public scrutiny.
Until 2016 exposed the mechanism, the Hewlett decoy was perfect: documented enough to seem real, famous enough to seem sufficient, and legal enough to shield the truth.

V. The Collective Theory: The Audience That Sees Itself
Perhaps the strangest and most revealing theory is the one that insists Banksy is not an individual at all but rather a collective. This idea survives not because it is evidentially strong but because it is psychologically flattering. It allows people to imagine themselves as part of the project. It transforms the artist into a movement, the signature into a symbol, the persona into a shared ethos.
This theory thrives in political circles that distrust individual genius narratives, in activist communities that valorize horizontal organization, in digital cultures that prefer open-source mythmaking to singular authorship. It is the most democratic of all the decoys and the one that most effectively disperses suspicion. It turns the public into both protector and participant.
The collective theory works because it allows the audience to recognize itself in the myth.

VI. The Architecture of the Myth
When the Gunningham archetype, the Del Naja aura, the Hewlett operation, and the collective fantasy are placed alongside one another, a pattern emerges that is too elegant to be accidental.
Each identity serves a different cultural constituency:

Gunningham appeals to working-class authenticity seekers and Bristol locals
Del Naja draws music fans and trip-hop nostalgia communities
Hewlett attracts animation/comic culture and legitimizes the corporate structure
Collective theory satisfies activists and anti-authoritarian mythmakers

Each draws a new demographic into the orbit. Each broadens the brand. And none of them - critically - threatens the safety of the true artist.
But more than cultural strategy, the system demonstrates operational tradecraft. Gunningham performed the role for crew who needed someone on-site. Hewlett performed the role for corporate filings that required a named owner. Del Naja performed the role for media that needed a plausible celebrity connection. The collective theory performs the role for idealists who need to believe in distributed authorship.
The result is an anonymity built through multiplication. Banksy hides behind not one face but many. The decoys form a shifting mask. The myth becomes a prism that reflects a different truth to each observer.
This is not evasion. This is design.

VII. The Ethics of the Phantom Celebrity
Banksy's anonymity now raises questions that no previous artist has had to confront. What does it mean when a fictional identity becomes a global celebrity? When millions interact with a persona deliberately constructed to misdirect them? When a public figure exists primarily as a curated absence?
The Pest Control rejection of Gunningham's authenticated work reveals the cynicism at the heart of the operation. The authentication office knew - institutionally, officially - that Gunningham wasn't Banksy. Yet the legend was allowed to flourish because it served the brand.
The 2016 Hewlett panic reveals the lengths to which the operation has gone to maintain corporate secrecy. Backdating transfers, panic filings, attorney "esq" gaffes - this is intelligence tradecraft applied to art world infrastructure.
This is not merely concealment. It is a new category of cultural phenomenon: a human brand that exists without a confirmed human. A persona that thrives on indeterminacy. A celebrity who is, in any conventional sense, not there.
The morality of this system is complicated. The audience enjoys the deception, participates in it, and reinforces it. The pleasure lies not in revelation but in the perpetual extension of the mystery. Banksy did not exploit a cultural weakness; he revealed a cultural appetite.
The public no longer demands to know the truth. It demands the pleasure of not knowing.

VIII. The First Artist Powered by Networked Anonymity
Before the rise of social media, anonymity relied on scarcity and retreat. Banksy's anonymity relies on abundance and acceleration. It needs viral rumor cycles, global meme-production, decentralized speculation, and a public trained to perform amateur forensics with a kind of gleeful futility. The identity game requires a constantly refreshed audience willing to mistake patterns for evidence because the patterns are entertaining.
Banksy did not simply benefit from the digital age; he is arguably the first artist whose myth could only exist in it.
The decoys aren't obstacles to this system - they're essential infrastructure. Gunningham provides the working-class authenticity. Del Naja provides the celebrity appeal. Hewlett provides the corporate legitimacy and animation-culture crossover. The collective theory provides the ideological cover.
Each false flag is a load-bearing pillar in a structure designed to keep the truth permanently obscured.

IX. The Last Layer of the Mask
If there is a single through-line in the entire Banksy phenomenon, it is that the artist understands attention - not as currency, but as clay. The decoys are not obstacles to the art. They are an extension of it. Each theory is a doorway. Each misidentification is a paint stroke. Each demographic drawn into the mystery becomes part of the composition.
The world has spent two decades attempting to unmask Banksy. Yet the truth may be that the mask is the masterpiece.
What makes the operation so sophisticated is the layering:

Cultural decoys (Gunningham, Del Naja) appeal to different audiences
Operational decoys (Hewlett) serve legal/corporate functions
Ideological decoys (collective theory) satisfy philosophical needs

And beneath all of them, the actual artist remains invisible - protected by a system where every investigation leads to someone who isn't quite right, every revelation turns out to be misdirection, every confident identification collapses under scrutiny.
Banksy's ultimate trick was not convincing millions that he could be anyone.
It was convincing them that he could be everyone.
In that collective misrecognition - in the pleasure of chasing phantoms built from photographers who became legends, musicians who became suspects, animators who became corporate shields - the artist created something unprecedented: a celebrity identity with no anchor in any single body, a persona built from the desires and projections of the crowd itself.
The false flags were never detours. They were the design.
And all of us, eager detectives scribbling theories in the margins of the internet, became the final collaborators.
